# Case Converter
We work with texts quite often, and it's very sad when it turns out that the text should have been written in a different case. 
Instead of editing it, you can create a simple application that does the job for us.

## Stages
**Stage 1/4: Everyone's a designer these days**\
Design your to-do list web page. Set CSS styles to make it neat.

**Stage 2/4: New tasks**\
Add new tasks to the list and remove them if they are no longer needed.

**Stage 3/4: Job's done**\
Work with checkboxes to mark tasks as complete and manage dynamic styles.

**Stage 4/4: Keep in memory**\
Store tasks in the local storage to keep them when the page is reloaded.
