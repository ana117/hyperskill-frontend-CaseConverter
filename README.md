# hyperskill-CaseConverter
We work with texts quite often, and it's very sad when it turns out that the text should have been written in a different case. 
Instead of editing it, you can create a simple application that does the job for us.

Link to the project [Case Converter](https://hyperskill.org/projects/193).

## Demo


## Stages
**Stage 1/3: The converter**\
Design the application page. Create the textarea element, buttons, and styles.

**Stage 2/3: Upper or lower**\
Add handlers for button and change the text case accordingly.

**Stage 3/3: Save me**\
Save the edited text as a .txt file. Generate and download it in the browser.
